# Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition and Fingerprint Authentication

An AI-powered Smart Attendance System that combines **Face Recognition**, **Fingerprint Authentication**, **ESP32**, **IoT**, and **Cloud Integration** to provide a secure, automated, and real-time attendance management solution.

This project was developed to eliminate manual attendance, prevent proxy attendance, and provide real-time attendance monitoring with cloud storage and automated notifications.

# Project Overview

The Smart Attendance System verifies the identity of a student using two levels of authentication:

1. Face Recognition
2. Fingerprint Verification

Attendance is recorded only when both authentications are successful.

The attendance data is automatically uploaded to Google Sheets, while SMS notifications are sent to parents and attendance reports are emailed to faculty members.
